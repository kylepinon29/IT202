<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Explain what data you'll be using from the API and how you plan to use it in the project</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>This&nbsp;BIN IP Checker API from RapidAPI is designed to provide information about bank<br>identification numbers (BINs) and their associated IP addresses. This API can be used<br>in my project by mapping BIN data to my database. The API routes<br>i intend to invoke for this information are from BIN Checker and BIN/IP<br>Checker within the API code.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> API Info</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>There are over&nbsp;+365,460 unique BINs. The limitation of interacting with the API is<br>that there are different plans that suit everyone including a free plan for<br>a small number of requests per day, but its rate is limited to<br>prevent abuse of the service.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
